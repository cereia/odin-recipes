      <li>Gather and prep all of your ingredients.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium high head. 
        <br>
        Then add ground beef and onion and cook until the beef is browned and crumbly and onions are translucent.
        <br>
        Keep cooking until all the liquid is evaporated, and keep stirring to prevent things sticking and burning.

      <li>
        Cook for about 3 minutes to let all the flavors meld, stirring occasionally. 
        <br>
        After that, put in broth, marinara, and diced tomatoes. Stir in the soy sauce and bring to a simmer.
        <br>
        Reduce the heat from medium high to medium and simmer for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Raise the heat to medium high and stir in macaroni and cook for about 12 minutes, until the macaroni is
        <br>
        barely tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pot from the head and remove the bay leaves. Stir in parsley then cover and rest for 5 minutes.
