    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather and prep all of your ingredients.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium high head. 
        Then add ground beef and onion and cook until the beef is browned and crumbly and onions are translucent.
        Keep cooking until all the liquid is evaporated, and keep stirring to prevent things sticking and burning.
        Now add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for about 3 minutes to let all the flavors meld, stirring occasionally. 
        After that, put in broth, marinara, and diced tomatoes. Stir in the soy sauce and bring to a simmer.
        Reduce the heat from medium high to medium and simmer for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Raise the heat to medium high and stir in macaroni and cook for about 12 minutes, until the macaroni is
        barely tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pot from the head and remove the bay leaves. Stir in parsley then cover and rest for 5 minutes.
        Season to taste.
      </li>
