<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Easy Chinese style pork chops that pair great with rice and some greens for a full meal.</p>
<p>These pork chops are easy to make and can be prepped well in advance for a quick and easy meal.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 tbsp of neutral oil</li>
  <li>2 pork chops, thawed</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp Shaoxing wine -- or any Chinese cooking wine</li>
  <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 tbsp potato starch</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 cup water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Score and pound pork chops so they're about 1/4 inch thick at most.</li>
  <li>In a bag or a bowl, combine soy sauce, salt, and wine to create a light marinade.
    <br>
    Add pork chops to the marinade and leave for at least 10 minutes to let the flavors meld.
  </li>
  <li>When you're ready to cook the pork chops, combine a little bit of the water, just a few tablesppons
    <br>
    to the potato starch in a small bowl to make a potato starch slurry. Mix thoroughly to ensure no clumps.
    <br>
    Add the potato starch slurry to the bag or bowl with the pork chops and mix to cover the porkchops.
  </li>
  <li>In a pan, add oil and heat on high. Make sure to swirl the oil around to coat the bottom of the pan.
    <br>
    Test the oil by sticking a chopstick or other wooden utensil in the oil.
    <br>
    If you see bubbles around the utensil, the oil is ready and you can carefully drop in your porkchops.
  </li>
  <li>Cook the pork chops on one side for about 30 seconds each, until each side is lightly colored.</li>
  <li>Add the remaining water to the marinade and pour into the pan. Cook at medium high heat for about 5 minutes. 
    <br>
    Make sure to flip the pork chops half way through.</li>
  <li>Remove from the heat and plate and pair with rice and veggies for a complete meal.</li>
